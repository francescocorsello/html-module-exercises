      <h4>GAME AUDIO / VR EXPERIENCES</h4>
      <h5>POLYARC AUDIO TEAM | MAY 12, 2022</h5>

      <p> <em>Moss: Book II</em> , the second installment in the Moss franchise, is an action-adventure puzzle game tailor-made for the VR platform. The game has a combination of both 3rd person and 1st person gameplay as you team up with a young mouse hero named Quill to try and save the world of Moss. While guiding Quill in combat and platforming using familiar action-adventure controls, you also take on the role of the Reader, Quill’s friend, and key ally. As the Reader, you are able to physically reach into the world and interact with things in the play space to help solve puzzles, assist in battle, and aid Quill in getting to where she needs to go. </p>

      <p>You are also able to reach in and interact with Quill herself. You can do things like give her high fives, pet her, and charge her weapons to give her an upper hand during combat. Part of the magic of the game is the emotional bond that you build with Quill throughout the game experience. <br><br>

        The Polyarc Moss II audio team consisted of three internal folk and two part-time contractors. Audio Director - Kristen Quinn (formerly Quebe), Senior Sound Designer - Sun Kim, and our Voice Director and Audio Engineer - Stephen Hodde. <br><br>
        
        Additional Sound Design contractors included Kyle Vande Slunt and Elise Kates. </p>

      <h5>The Pendulum</h5>
      <img src="https://info.audiokinetic.com/hubfs/Blog_Images/Moss%20Book%20II%20Crafting%20a%20Tactile%20and%20Analog%20Feel%20in%20VR%20with%20Audio/img3.png" title="pic1" width="800"  alt="The pendulum level in a jungle"  >
      
        <p>The pendulum is set up how a device would have been set up in Moss 1. It's all logic driven in blueprint. The pendulum is suspended from a point on the ceiling. The blue orb represents the player’s controller / reader's hand. You can reach out to grab and move the pendulum along an arc. If the pendulum is close enough, Quill can jump on the platform which can also shift based on Quill's weight. When the player releases the pendulum it will swing back and forth and eventually come to a resting point once it loses enough speed. As the Reader, you can release the pendulum at its maximum potential height, or the valley of the arc, each creating a different response from the device. You can also grab it and interrupt the movement at any point. <br><br>

          The pendulum emits sounds from three different locations: The pivot point up by the ceiling, the bottom platform , and the joint location just above the platform. At the platform level we play the following content in a blend container. <br><br>
          
          Swing Tension - the metal stress and pressure that is put on the device as it's moving. This is broken up into mid and low end frequency loops so that we can tune them differently
          Foliage - the sound for the plants attached to the platform
          Wind - resonant low air that is dispersed as the platform moves through space. </p>

        <h5>Final Thoughts</h5>
        
        <p>
            Devices play such an important role in this game. They are made believable by crafting dynamic audio systems where content changes based on device behaviors and the player’s actions in game. By creating a unique device component, we are able to save time on implementation and spend more time focusing on content. This allows for more time tuning the system. We hope this gives players an enjoyable experience that feels analog when reaching into the world and interacting with devices. Working on Moss: Book II has been an incredible experience and we feel extremely lucky to get to share it with you. Thanks so much for going on this journey with us.  </p>
