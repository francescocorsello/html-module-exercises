      <p>Moss: Book II, the second installment in the Moss franchise, is an action-adventure puzzle game tailor-made for the VR platform. The game has a combination of both 3rd person and 1st person gameplay as you team up with a young mouse hero named Quill to try and save the world of Moss. While guiding Quill in combat and platforming using familiar action-adventure controls, you also take on the role of the Reader, Quill’s friend, and key ally. As the Reader, you are able to physically reach into the world and interact with things in the play space to help solve puzzles, assist in battle, and aid Quill in getting to where she needs to go. </p>

      <p>You are also able to reach in and interact with Quill herself. You can do things like give her high fives, pet her, and charge her weapons to give her an upper hand during combat. Part of the magic of the game is the emotional bond that you build with Quill throughout the game experience. 

        The Polyarc Moss II audio team consisted of three internal folk and two part-time contractors. Audio Director - Kristen Quinn (formerly Quebe), Senior Sound Designer - Sun Kim, and our Voice Director and Audio Engineer - Stephen Hodde.
        
        Additional Sound Design contractors included Kyle Vande Slunt and Elise Kates. </p>
